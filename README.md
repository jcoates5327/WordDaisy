# WordDaisy

This program converts Microsoft Word documents containing MathType equations into accessible documents in the DAISY format. Uses the OpenXML SDK and MathType SDK.

This tool replaces an extension for Word that does the same thing just waaay slower. Documents with several hundred MathType equations would take upwards of 10 - 15 minutes to convert; with this tool, conversions typically took around a minute.

Optionally, the DAISY XML output can be automatically fed into MathSpeaker to produce an accessible HTML book.
